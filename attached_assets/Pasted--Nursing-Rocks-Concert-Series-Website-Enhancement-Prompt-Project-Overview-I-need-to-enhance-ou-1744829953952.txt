# Nursing Rocks! Concert Series Website Enhancement Prompt

## Project Overview
I need to enhance our existing Nursing Rocks! Concert Series website to celebrate and honor nursing professionals across America. This concert series will feature prominent rock headliners performing at venues nationwide, with special program elements dedicated to honoring nurses. The concerts will be free for registered nurses, with tickets provided by sponsors.

## Core Mission

  - Venue information (capacity ranging from 1,200 to 8,000 seats)
