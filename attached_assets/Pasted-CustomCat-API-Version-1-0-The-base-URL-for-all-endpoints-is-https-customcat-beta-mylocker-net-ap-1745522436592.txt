CustomCat API
Version 1.0
The base URL for all endpoints is https://customcat-beta.mylocker.net/api/v1/
Getting Started:
Select your intended use:
1. I am a seller and I want to use CustomCat's product mock-ups to place products on my website AND have CustomCat fulfill my orders.
2. I am a seller and I have my own product mock-ups. I want to use CustomCat to ONLY fulfill my orders.
3. I am a site owner that enables multiple sellers to upload designs and sell products. I have my own mock-ups and I want to use CustomCat to ONLY fulfill my orders. I want to handle all transactions outside of CustomCat. CustomCat will charge me directly and will not provide support for my sellers.
4. I am a site owner that operates a platform for users to sell products. I want my sellers to use CustomCat features and technology to upload designs and generate products to sell on my site. I want CustomCat to handle all seller transactions and I am not involved. CustomCat will provide support for my sellers.
Authentication:
Authentication and identification to the CustomCat API is done by providing an API Key on every request. CustomCat also requires that all communication with the API is secured using TLS. Requests made over HTTP or without a proper API Key will fail.

CustomCat provides two types of API Keys: Read and Write.

You can manage your API Keys from your account.

Treat your API Keys as passwords, keep them secret. API Keys give full read/write access to your account, so they should not be included in public repositories, emails, client side code, etc. If your key gets leaked, you can disable it through your account under API Keys

Design Placement Presets
When using external design URLs you can pass the string, "preset_id" where the design will be trimmed and positioned based on the preset options below; but it is not a required string. IF you do NOT pass a "preset_id", we will NOT trim the transparent space and enlarge the artwork. Instead, the artwork is positioned based on the placement of the design inside the Art Board, with negative space observed.
PRESET OPTIONS:

Address Verification Services (AVS):
Both U.S. and International shipping addresses are checked to be complete. Currently only U.S. addresses are verified using an address verification service. We test the city, state and zip code combination against an authoritative database of known addresses. If the address in question matches an address in the official database, the address "validates", meaning it's a real address. Addresses that do not match any addresses in the database are marked as "invalid", meaning the address either doesn't exist or isn't registered with the official postal service. For purposes of the API request we will return a standard 400 error with a description of the error. If available the response will also include a list of possible matches for address correction. Examples of an incomplete and invalid shipping address is shown below.

webhook
Description:
Webhooks are a useful tool for shops that want to execute code after a specific event happens on CustomCat. Instead making an API call to check if a specific event has occured, you can register webhooks, which send an HTTP request from CustomCat telling your shop that the event has occurred.

Topics:
The topic is a combination of the resource (ex. order) and event (ex. shipped)

Available Topics:
Resource	Event	Topic	Description
Order	shipped	order-shipped	Full order has shipped. View JSON
Order	partial-shipment	order-partial-shipment	If multiple shipments are needed. Order shipped is called when the last item is shipped. View JSON
Product	created	product-created	The seller creates a new product in CustomCat View JSON
Product	deleted	product-deleted	The seller deletes a product in CustomCat
Product	updated	product-updated	The seller updates a product in CustomCat

Error Codes & Responses
HTTP Status Codes
The CustomCat API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.

Code	Text	Description
200	OK	Success!
304	Not Modified	There was no new data to return.
400	Bad Request	The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. Usually caused by bad input data. An accompanying error message in the "X-FAIL-MESSAGE" header field will explain further.
401	Unauthorized	API Key was missing or incorrect.
403	Forbidden	The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed. An accompanying error message in the "X-FAIL-MESSAGE" header field will explain why. This usually occurs when trying to call a write operation using a read-only API key.
404	Not Found	The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a cart, does not exists. The message in "X-FAIL-MESSAGE" header field will explain why.
405	Not Allowed	The requested verb is not allowed for this resource. For example, trying to do a POST on the "shippping" resource
500	Internal Server Error	Something is broken. Please contact us.
502	Bad Gateway	The API is down or being upgraded.
If you see an error response which is not listed in the above table, then fall back to the HTTP status code in order to determine the best way to address the error.
